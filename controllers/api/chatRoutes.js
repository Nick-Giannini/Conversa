// This is the route that gets a specific room and its associated users and messages.  A team member must have changed this route because when Dave annotated this file, the param ":id" was missing from the "router.get" line and this was previously working in Insomnia using the "/api/chat/:id" route.  It now uses the "/api/:id route."
